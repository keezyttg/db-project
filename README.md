# FlexZone Fitness Database Project

This project implements a small relational database for a gym called FlexZone Fitness.  
It includes a full schema, sample data, test queries, and an application interface.

---

## 1. Files Included

- schema.sql  
  Creates all database tables and constraints.

- data.sql  
  Inserts sample data for Membership, Member, Staff, Class, ClassSession, and Payment.

- gym.db  
  SQLite database file generated by running schema.sql and data.sql.

- test_queries.sql  
  Five test queries used to validate the database.

- app.py  
  Command-line application interface for interacting with the database.

- README.md  
  Instructions for running and testing the project.

## 2. How to Set Up the Database

### Step 1: Open the project folder in terminal


### Step 2: Create the database

Start SQLite:


### Step 3: Load schema

Inside the SQLite prompt:


### Step 4: Load sample data


### Step 5: Verify tables loaded


You should see:

3. Record a payment  
4. Add a class session  
5. View sessions for a trainer  
6. Exit  

All operations directly modify gym.db.

- SQLite3 (built into macOS and Linux)  
- No external libraries required  

The project works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## 6. Team Members and Responsibilities

- Lorenzo Jackson — schema design, SQL implementation, CLI coding  
- Malachi Fowler — ER diagram and interface testing  
- Jonathan DeRose — sample data generation and query testing

## 7. Notes

If the grader cannot run the code, they should ensure:

- The database file is in the same folder as app.py  
- SQLite3 is installed  
- Python 3 is installed  

The project is fully self-contained.
