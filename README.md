# FlexZone Fitness Database Project

This project implements a small relational database for a gym called FlexZone Fitness.  
It includes a full schema, sample data, test queries, and an application interface.

---

## 1. Files Included

- schema.sql  
  Creates all database tables and constraints.

- data.sql  
  Inserts sample data for Membership, Member, Staff, Class, ClassSession, and Payment.

- gym.db  
  SQLite database file generated by running schema.sql and data.sql.

- test_queries.sql  
  Five test queries used to validate the database.

- app.py  
  Command-line application interface for interacting with the database.

- README.md  
  Instructions for running and testing the project.

## 2. How to Set Up the Database

### Step 1: Open the project folder in terminal
Navigate into the folder where your SQL files are stored.

### Step 2: Create the database

Start SQLite:
sqlite3 gym.db


### Step 3: Load schema

Inside the SQLite prompt:
.read schema.sql


### Step 4: Load sample data

.read data.sql

### Step 5: Verify tables loaded
.tables


You should see:

Membership  
Member  
Staff  
Class  
ClassSession  
Payment

## 3. Running the Application Interface (app.py)

Make sure you are in the same directory as app.py and gym.db, then run:
python3 app.py


The menu allows you to:

1. Add a new member  
2. Update membership status  
3. Record a payment  
4. Add a class session  
5. View sessions for a trainer  
6. Exit  

All operations directly modify gym.db.

## 4. Running the Test Queries

To execute the 5 test queries for grading:
    sqlite3 gym.db < test_queries.sql

This prints formatted query results to the terminal.

---

## 5. Requirements and Compatibility

- Python 3.x  
- SQLite3 (built into macOS and Linux)  
- No external libraries required  

The project works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## 6. Team Members and Responsibilities

- Lorenzo Jackson: Wrote the enterprise description and justification, created the ER diagram, generated the database data, wrote the test queries, and built the application user interfaces.
- Jonathan DeRose: Created the relational schema used in the final database, reviewed and refined the constraints, assisted with the ER diagram, and used the schema to build the tables and define their attributes.
- Malachi Fowler: Scheduled team meetings, coordinated group communication, and helped plan the database structure and contribute to the ER diagram and relationship design.

## 7. Notes

If anything fails to run, check that gym.db is in the same directory as the Python file. Python 3 and SQLite3 must be installed. The project is fully self contained once the schema and data are loaded.
